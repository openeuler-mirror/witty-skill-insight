REPORT_PROMPT = """
You are an expert technical writer and code reviewer.
Your task is to generate a comprehensive "Optimization Report" (CHANGELOG) for a Skill improvement process.

# Input Data

1. **Original Skill Genome**:
{original_skill}

2. **Optimized Skill Genome**:
{optimized_skill}

3. **Diagnoses (Issues Found)**:
{diagnoses_text}

# Task
Generate a Markdown report named `OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`.
The report should include:

1. **Executive Summary**: A brief overview of the optimization focus (e.g., "Fixed security risks and improved error handling").
2. **Diagnosis Summary**: A table or list summarizing the key issues identified (Severity, Type, Description).
3. **Detailed Changelog**:
   - List the specific changes made to the Skill content (Role, Structure, Instructions, etc.).
   - **Crucially**, explain *WHY* each change was made, referencing the specific Diagnosis that triggered it.
   - If auxiliary files were added/modified, list them and explain their purpose.
4. **Before/After Diff Highlights**:
   - Show key snippets of "Before" vs "After" to demonstrate the improvement (e.g., how a specific rule was rewritten).

# Format
- Use standard Markdown.
- Be professional, concise, and educational.
- Use emojis where appropriate to make it readable (e.g., 🐛 for bugs, ✅ for fixes).
- Language: Chinese (Simplified) as per user preference.
